### Our application
This application is made with the intention to improve the travelling experience through the implementation of an Itinerary Planner, Tourist Attraction Locator and Tip Calculator. The UI is built to be simple and easy to understand, for quick use during a busy day. The Itinerary Planner optimises your journey based on time and cost, giving you the best route to your desired locations.
